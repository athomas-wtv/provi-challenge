# Provi Challenge
## Instructions to Run App
1. Go to [this site](https://example.com) and download the .NET SDK. I used .NET Core 3.1 but you should be able to use .NET Core 5. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDuUQNU7hWM) is a good resource to learn how if you prefer a walk-through video. To check if it worked, go inside your terminal and type `dotnet --version`. You should see the version installed if it worked.
2. Now to download my app. [Go here](https://github.com/athomas-wtv/park-bot) and clone my project.
3. Navigate into the file and type `dotnet build` then `dotnet run`. The app should be running an is ready for input. The only input that it will take are integers. If you try anything else, it'll ask you to try again.
